Your healthcare provider can perform tests to diagnose any possible infection and provide the appropriate treatment. Have you had any recent changes in sexual partners or unprotected sex?"

It's a good idea to get tested regularly if you're sexually active, especially if you have new or multiple partners. Until you see a healthcare provider, avoid sexual activity to prevent the potential spread of infection."
