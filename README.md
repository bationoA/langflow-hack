# Langflow-Hack
Build with Low-Code: Langflow Hack 


Welcome to the Synapse Copilot Automation AI project! This repository contains the implementation of an AI agent designed to automate various tasks across several SaaS platforms including `Facebook`, `Asana`, `Trello`, `Clockify`, `Todoist`, and `DeskZoho`. 
Leveraging the capabilities of `Python`, `GPT-3 turbo`, and `DALL-E 3`, this AI agent streamlines workflow processes and enhances productivity by automating user-specified tasks.

## Project Source
This project is based on Synapse Copilot open source project that you can have here: [https://github.com/Agile-Loop/Synapse-Copilot](https://github.com/Agile-Loop/Synapse-Copilot).

## Features

* Text Posting: Posts user-provided text to Facebook.
* Content Generation: Generates and posts text based on specified subjects.
* Multimedia Posts: Creates and posts both text-only and text-plus-image content.
* Image Generation: Generates images from text and includes them in posts.
* SaaS Automation: Integrates with `Asana`, `Trello`, `Clockify`, `Todoist`, and `DeskZoho` to automate various tasks.

## Technologies Used

* Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the AI agent. 
* GPT-3 turbo: Utilized for generating and processing natural language text. 
* DALL-E 3: Used for generating images from text descriptions. 
* Synapse Copilot: Facilitates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with multiple APIs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* OpenAI API key (for GPT-3 turbo and DALL-E 3)
* API keys for integrated SaaS platforms (Facebook, Asana, Trello, Clockify, Todoist, DeskZoho)
